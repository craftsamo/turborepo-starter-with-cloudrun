description: Use when incorporating upstream changes into this fork via git rebase and resolving the resulting conflicts (取り込む / リベース / 追従). Covers fetch upstream, a backup tag, the rebase ours/theirs swap, the three conflict buckets (textual / type-ripple / silent drift), a coupling audit for fork-only surfaces, nps verification, and the two landing paths (direct-to-main vs follow-up PR). Trigger keywords: "upstream", "rebase", "sync upstream", "merge conflict", "fork", "取り込む", "リベース", "追従".

<Goal>

Replay this fork's commits on top of the latest `upstream/main`, classify what
the sync touched (textual conflict vs. ripple vs. silent drift), resolve/land it
on the correct path, and keep a linear, recoverable history.

</Goal>

<Scope>

- Remotes: `origin` = this fork, `upstream` = the repo this fork tracks. This is
  the git `upstream` remote (`git remote get-url upstream`), NOT the opencode
  `references.upstream` read-only clone (that one is only for comparison).
- Layer-agnostic: this fork may itself be the upstream of another fork. "upstream"
  always = whatever the git `upstream` remote points to. Each layer derives its
  own surfaces — do not hardcode app/package names.
- Fork-only surfaces = paths that exist ONLY in this fork (upstream never edits
  them, so git never conflicts them — this is where silent drift hides). Don't
  assume them; COMPUTE them for your layer after fetching:
  - fork-added files:     `git diff --diff-filter=A --name-only upstream/main HEAD`
  - fork-modified shared: `git diff --diff-filter=M --name-only upstream/main HEAD`
- Verify with `nps` (turbo fans out to every workspace, incl. fork-only apps).

</Scope>

<Steps>

### 1. Preflight

1. Clean tree — never rebase a dirty tree: `git status` (stash/commit first).
2. Ensure the remote exists: `git remote get-url upstream` (else
   `git remote add upstream <url>`).
3. `git switch main`.
4. `git fetch upstream`.
5. Record the base: `BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/main)`.
6. Preview:
   - incoming:   `git log --oneline $BASE..upstream/main`
   - replayed:   `git log --oneline upstream/main..HEAD`
   - divergence: `git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...upstream/main`

### 2. Backup (recovery point)

`git tag backup/pre-rebase-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M) main`
Undo anytime with `git reset --hard <tag>`.

### 3. Rebase

- `git rebase upstream/main`
- To preserve PR merge commits: `git rebase --rebase-merges upstream/main`
  (default flattens them — usually fine for a fork).

### 4. Resolve conflicts — mind the ours/theirs SWAP

During rebase the sides are REVERSED vs a merge:
- `--ours` / `HEAD` = `upstream/main` (the new base) + already-replayed commits.
- `--theirs`        = the fork commit currently being applied (your change).

Per conflict: reconcile `<<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>`, then `git add` →
`git rebase --continue`. Use `git rebase --skip` if the commit is already in
upstream, `git rebase --abort` to bail to the backup. Never blanket `-X ours` /
`-X theirs` across the whole rebase.

### 5. Classify — the three buckets (this decides the landing path)

| Bucket | What | Detect with | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Textual conflict | overlapping edits (`<<<<<<<`) | git marks them during rebase | resolve inline |
| 2. Type/behaviour ripple | clean apply, but types/build/tests break | `nps typecheck` / `nps build` / `nps test` (turbo hits every workspace) | follow-up PR |
| 3. Silent drift | clean apply, `nps` green, but a fork-only surface is stale (e.g. a fork-only doc section, or an env var the fork introduced that upstream just renamed) | coupling audit (step 6) + review | follow-up PR |

Decision rule: **bucket 1 only ∧ `nps` green ∧ audit clean → Path 1**, otherwise
**→ Path 2**.

Conflict vs. follow-up: if git put a marker on it → conflict resolution
(reconcile the overlapping lines, add NO new behavior). If it applied cleanly but
is now inconsistent → follow-up implementation. Do NOT fold follow-up work into a
conflict-resolution commit.

### 6. Coupling audit (bucket 3 — `nps` cannot see this)

1. Compute YOUR fork-only surfaces (don't hardcode):
   `FORK_ONLY=$(git diff --diff-filter=A --name-only upstream/main HEAD)`
2. What upstream changed in shared coupling surfaces:
   `git diff $BASE..upstream/main --stat`   # shared packages, configs, env, docs
3. For each changed shared symbol/convention (a shared type/constant shape, an env
   var name, a doc convention), grep your fork-only surfaces for stale refs:
   `git grep -n "<symbol-or-name>" -- $FORK_ONLY`
4. Compiles green but now inconsistent (stale docs, old env name, outdated contract
   impl) = bucket 3 → schedule a follow-up PR.

Semi-mechanical: diff + grep + judgment. `nps` never flags prose/semantic/
runtime-string drift.

### 7. Land

**Path 1 — direct to main (sync only).** Bucket 1 only, `nps` green, audit clean:
`git push --force-with-lease origin main`
(rebase rewrote your commits → force is required; `--force-with-lease` refuses if
origin moved; the backup tag is your undo.)

**Path 2 — follow-up needed (PR).** Bucket 2/3 present:
- 2-a (preferred, when the rebase itself is green): land the clean rebase via
  Path 1 first, then do the adaptation as a NORMAL branch → PR → review/CI → merge
  on top of the synced main (no force-push).
- 2-b (when the rebase is red until adapted): keep rebase + adaptation together on
  `sync/upstream-<date>`, get it green, push the branch, open a PR for review/CI,
  then land with
  `git switch main && git reset --hard sync/upstream-<date> && git push --force-with-lease`
  (keeps linear history; the PR is the review gate). Avoid GitHub squash-merge here
  — it pushes main off the "upstream + patches" line and complicates the next rebase.

</Steps>

<Verify>

- `nps build` / `nps lint` / `nps typecheck` / `nps test` — green clears bucket 2.
- Run the coupling audit (step 6) even when green — bucket 3 is invisible to `nps`.

</Verify>

<AntiPatterns>

- Do NOT `git pull` on main — it creates a merge; this flow is rebase-only.
- Do NOT confuse the rebase swap: `--ours` = upstream, `--theirs` = your fork commit.
- Do NOT blanket `-X ours` / `-X theirs` an entire rebase.
- Do NOT rebase a dirty tree, and do NOT skip the backup tag.
- Do NOT plain `git push --force` — use `--force-with-lease`.
- Do NOT force-push a red rebase to main — that's bucket 2/3 → Path 2.
- `nps` green ≠ done — always run the coupling audit for fork-only drift (bucket 3).
- Do NOT fold follow-up implementation into a conflict-resolution commit.
- Do NOT hardcode fork-only paths — compute them (`git diff --diff-filter=A`).

</AntiPatterns>
